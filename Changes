          - silly mistake in examples/application_client_test.pl fixed
          - link to today's Perl Advent Calendar entry, about this module :)

0.012     2012-12-01 22:57:01 PST-0800 (Karen Etheridge)
          - examples/ directory added, containing fleshed-out code snippets
            used in the article for the 2012 Perl Advent Calendar, and a
            detailed example of some unit tests for a client library

          - remove additional options in constructor before passing to
            LWP::UserAgent (was causing a carp when $^W was set) - thanks for
            the report and patch, Nigel Gregoire and Michael Schulthess!
          - all remaining uses of eval eliminated, by using better heuristics
            for "can be used as a coderef" logic

0.010     2012-10-06 16:47:33 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - documentation on integration with XML::Compile::SOAP
          - questionable uses of eval { $foo->isa } converted to Safe::Isa
          - imported symbols are no longer available as methods

0.009     2012-08-29 09:54:34 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - fix test to work with older (pre-6.00) LWP::UserAgent, when
            _new_response did not take a content argument

0.008     2012-08-21 12:48:35 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - better handling when the response implementation dies, either
            with an error message or an HTTP::Response object
          - network_fallback and map_network_response features added, for
            sending any or all requests through to the real LWP::UserAgent
          - new feature: "last_useragent", for getting the last useragent
            object used globally
          - allow exact string matching against domains to work even for
            domains specified via a string-overloaded object
          - bug fix: properly mask existing mappings in
            $ua->map_response(..., undef) (v0.007)

0.007     2012-08-14 13:56:50 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - cleanup of domain->PSGI app functionality for stable release:
            - string mappings in map_response now match against the URI host,
              not the full URI string
            - register_domain is now called register_psgi; unregister_domain
              is now unregister_psgi; unregister_all is removed, as unmap_all
              will do the right thing
            - domain mappings no longer take priority over other mapped
              responses; all mappings are now tested in the order they were
              added (with instance mappings matched first over global
              mappings, as before)

0.006-TRIAL  2012-07-28 16:03:24 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - new domain->PSGI app functionality, and methods register_domain,
            unregister_domain, unregister_all

0.005     2012-07-20 17:37:26 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - additional error checking and tests
          - also support objects with &{} overloading, in place of subrefs
          - now doing the same end-of-response cleanup handling that the real LWPUA does:
            - saving the request on the response
            - adding Client-Date header
            - respect show_progress settings
            - runs handlers

0.004     2012-06-27 15:41:02 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - map_response now accepts a coderef in place of the HTTP::Response
            object to return, to allow basing the response data on what was in
            the request

0.003     2012-06-23 22:11:53 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - fix compile error on perls earlier than 5.9.5 (which did not have
            re::is_regexp)

0.002     2012-06-23 09:36:51 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - minor documentation fixes
          - renamed from Test::Mock::LWP::UserAgent to Test::LWP::UserAgent
            (thanks, mst!)

0.001     2012-06-22 17:11:20 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - Initial release, in all its questionable glory.
