# This example demonstrates how one might go about writing some tests for a
# client library that interacts with a RESTful API. At a minimum, we want to
# test when we receive a network timeout (which is quite common and all
# clients must be able to handle), a failed query and a successful query.

# Note that *we are not testing the network*, but testing the code that
# interacts with the network. Therefore, we need to make the network behave in
# different ways so we can test how we interact with it.
